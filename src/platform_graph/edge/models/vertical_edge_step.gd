# Some vertical start and stop state for a movement.

# -   Each overall (edge) movement consists of a single vertical step and a
#     series of horizontal steps.
# -   A vertical step could represent the pressing of the jump button (for
#     jump movements).
# -   Or a vertical step could just be a placeholder for storing some of the
#     vertical movement state (for fall movements).


# The time at which movement for this step should reach the maximum height.
var time_peak_height: float

# The maximum height position for this step.

# Whether the jump button can be held in order to apply slow-rise and
