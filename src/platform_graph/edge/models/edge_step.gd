class_name EdgeStep
extends Reference
# Some start and stop state for a single input command.
# 
# This is used internally to make edge calculation easier. These are converted
# to EdgeInstructions before the edges are finalized and stored.
# 
# Each overall (edge) movement consists of a single vertical step and a series
# of horizontal steps.
# 
# -   A vertical step will always have its jump instruction starting at the
#     same time as the overall step.
# -   A vertical step usually will not have its jump instruction ending at the
#     same time as the overall step.
# -   A horizontal step may have its move instruction starting after the start
#     of the overall step.
#     -   This happens when the step needs to use a step-end x velocity that
#         is greater than the minimum possible.
# -   A horizontal step may have its move instruction ending before the
#     overall step.
#     -   This happens when the step uses the slowest step-end x velocity
#         possible.
# -   A horizontal step will always have either
#     time_instruction_end == time_step_end or
#     time_instruction_start == time_step_start.
# 
# Note: There is an important distinction between the end of the movement step
#       and the end of the input instruction within the step:
# -   "step_end": The time at which movement should reach the intended
#     destination position for this part of the overall movement. That is,
#     this would either be the overall destination position of the edge, or
#     the start position of the next step.
# -   "instruction_end": The time at which the input_key should be released
#     for this step. This is likely to happen before "step_end". If this is a
#     vertical step, then this is the point at which the step starts using
#     fast-fall gravity. If this is a horizontal step, then this is the point
#     at which horizontal acceleration stops.
