# Platform graph inspector

As you might imagine, the calculations for these edges can get quite complicated. To make these calculations easier to understand and debug, we created a powerful platform graph inspector. This can be accessed from the inspector panel (the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen).

The inspector is a tree-view widget with the following structure:

```
 - Platform graph [character_name]
   - Edges [#]
     - [#] Edges calculated with increasing jump height
       - JUMP_FROM_SURFACE_EDGEs [#]
         - [(x,y), (x,y)]
           - Profiler
             - ...
           - EDGE_VALID_WITH_INCREASING_JUMP_HEIGHT [1]
             - 1: Movement is valid.

         - _# valid outbound edges_

```

Each entry in this inspector tree is encoded with annotation information which will render debugging info over the level for the corresponding entity. Additionally, each entry contains a detailed description. These are both shown when selecting the entry.
