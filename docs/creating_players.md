# Creating players

> TODO

- Each player should have a child `CollisionShape2D` that defines its collision boundary.
- The center of each players' collision boundary should be at (0,0).
- The rotation of each players' collision boundary should only be either 0 or 90 degrees.
- The rotation (or shape) of a player's collision boundary must never change--even when the player transitions from walking along a floor to climbing along a wall.
